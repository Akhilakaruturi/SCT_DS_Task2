Project Overview:
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to understand the dataset, handle missing values, explore relationships between variables, and identify patterns and trends that influenced passenger survival.

This project is suitable for:
Data Analysis beginners
Academic assignments
Portfolio projects
Kaggle practice

 Dataset :
Source: Kaggle – Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
File Used: train.csv
Description: Contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

Tools Used:
Python, Google Colab
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The following analyses were performed:
Survival count analysis
Survival based on Gender
Survival based on Passenger Class
Age distribution of passengers
Fare distribution
Age vs Survival
Correlation heatmap of numerical variables

 Key Insights:
Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males
Passengers in 1st class survived more than those in 3rd class
Higher fare passengers had better survival chances
Younger passengers were more likely to survive
Passenger class and fare showed strong correlation with survival
